## Competitive Coding Repository 
This repository contains some useful codes, techniques, *algorithms*, *data structures* and problem solutions helpful in Competitive Coding.
Additionally, we have a [blog](https://sahilbansal17.github.io/Competitive_Coding/) explaining some of the concepts or problem solutions, whose source code is in the [gh-pages-source](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/tree/gh-pages-source) branch.

### Algorithms
The algorithms list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Algorithms). The folder [Algorithms](Algorithms/) contains all the implementations.

### Data Structures
The data structures list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Data-Structures). The folder [Data Structures](Data%20Structures) contains all the implementations.

### Problem Solutions
The solutions to various problems in different contests or practice problems on the following sites are available in [Problem Solutions](Problem%20Solutions/) folder.

### Template for Contests
Some tricks and templates are available in [Templates](Templates/) folder.
