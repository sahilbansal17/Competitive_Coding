## Competitive Coding Repository 
This project aims to create a vast collection of *algorithms* and *data structures* that can be helpful in Competitive Coding along with the solutions to various problems on various competitive coding platforms.

### Algorithms
The algorithms list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Algorithms). The folder [Algorithms](Algorithms/) contains all the implementations.

### Data Structures
The data structures list is available in this [wiki page](https://github.com/sahilbansal17/Competitive_Coding/wiki/Data-Structures). The folder [Data Structures](Data%20Structures) contains all the implementations.

### Problem Solutions
The solutions to various problems in different contests or practice problems on the following sites are available in [Problem Solutions](Problem%20Solutions/) folder.

### Template for Contests
Templates are available in [Templates](Templates/) folder.
