/*

Given a balanced binary search tree (take a sample tree in your code) and a number x, 
your task is to determine if there exists a pair of nodes, such that their sum is equal to x.
Every node contains a value, left ptr and right ptr.

The following tasks need to be done for an entire score:

1. Return the larger of the two numbers if there exists a pair, else -1 in time O(n).
2. Space taken should be less than O(n).
3. Explanations for all methods and time/space complexities.

// Time Complexity : O(n)

// 		     O(n) for a tree having n nodes. So time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).

// Space Complexity : O(log n)
// 		      The stack stores all the ancestors of the current node. So the maximum size of stack at
// 		      any point of time can be O(h) as maximum number of ancestors of any node can be maximum
// 		      h. And since this is a balanced BST h= O(logN).
// 		      So space complexity is O(logn)
