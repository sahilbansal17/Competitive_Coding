# This is a small program that runs two processes, connecting the
# stdin of each one to the stdout of the other.
# It doesn't perform a lot of checking, so many errors may
# be caught internally by Python (e.g., if your command line has incorrect
# syntax) or not caught at all (e.g., if the judge or solution hangs).
#
# Run this as:
# python interactive_runner.py <cmd_line_judge> -- <cmd_line_solution>
#
# For example:
# python interactive_runner.py python testing_tool.py 0 -- ./my_binaRy
#
# this will run the first test set of a python judge called "testing_tool.py"
# that receives the test set number (starting from 0) via command line parameter
# with a solution compiled into a binary called "my_binary".
#
# This is only intended as a convenient tool to help contestants test solutions
# locally. In particular, it is not identical to the implementation on our
# server, which is more complex.
