/*Bellmanford's algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm which can give all possible shortest part from a given source vertex to all the vertex in the graph containing negative or positive weighted edges and not having any negative weight cycle(a cycle of graph resulting negative weight as whole).It is a dynamic programming algorithm as need to use previous solutions of subproblems becuase we don't know future paths at the begining */

/*This is the Function for implementation of Bellmanford's algorithm for a graph having postive of negative weighted edges but not having negative weight cycle. 
At first we initialise all the distances of vertices as maximum integer value and distance of source vertex as .
The shortest path in a graph with V vertex can at most contain V-1 vertex ,so we iterate first i loop for V-1 times and within this loop we check and update distances for each vertex by taking each edges one by one as,
distance[destination vertex of edge]=[(distance[Source vertex of edge]+weight of edge) if(distance[Source of edge]+weight of edge) is less than current distance[destination vertex of the edge].

Time Complexity of this function is O((V-1)*E) as the max opertions are in a loop running for (v-1)*E times .
O(V)+O((V-1)*E)+O(V) is the key operations here for the Key Operations.Thus Time Complexity is O((V-1)*E)
