/*   The following is an implementation of Prim's algorithm
    using adjacency list representation of a graph. The data structure
    min heap is used for this. There are, again, two implementations
    in this, the min heap code can be written differently in a class, or
    the priority_queue present in STL can be used. Here, it's the
    latter.
    Now, a priority_queue is essentially a max heap, but can be used
    as given below to form a min heap. The loop statements execute
    v+e times, in addition to log(v) time for adding to priority_queue.
    Overall, O(v+e)*O(log(v)) = O((e+v)*log(v))
    e = O(v^2) for dense graphs, because e <= v*(v-1)/2 for any connected graph.
    And e = O(v), or, v = O(e) for sparsely connected graphs.
    Hence, O((e+v)*log(v)) = O(e*log(v)).
    The pop() and top() operations take O(log(v)) and O(1) time
    respectively.
