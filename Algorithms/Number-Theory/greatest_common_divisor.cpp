//Time and Space Complexities--------
//gcdNaive() function:- 
	//Time Complexity: O(n) because the loop runs for the minimum of the two inputs.
	//Space Complexity: O(1)
	
//gcd() function:-
	//Time Complexity: 

	//O(logn) this is the main advantage of Euclid's algorithm that it has great complexity
	//the reccurence relation for the euclids algorithm is T(n) = T(n%10) + k  ; k is the constant amount of work
	//and by calculation we will get n/10^x= 1 which gives x= log n whic is the time complexity .
	//Consider any two steps of the algorithm.
	//At some point, you have the numbers (a,b)(a,b) with a>b. After the first step these turn to (b,c) with c=a mod b, 
	//and after the second step the two numbers will be (c,d) with d=b mod c.
	//Now think backwards. As d=b mod c, we know that b=kc+d for some k>0. The smallest possibility is k=1, therefore bâ‰¥c+d.
	//From that result and from a>b we get a>c+d. If we add the last two inequalities we just derived, we get that (a+b)>2(c+d).
	//In words, after each two consecutive steps the sum of the two numbers decreases to less than half of its original size.
	//Now look at the very first step of the algorithm. 
	//At the beginning, we have some (a,b) with a>b. After the very first step we have (b,c) with c=a mod b, and clearly b>c. 
	//Hence, after the very first step both numbers are at most equal to the smaller of the two input numbers.
	//Putting those two results together, we may conclude that the number of iterations (recursive calls in other implementations) 
	//is at most logarithmic in the smaller input number. In other words, the number of iterations is at most linear in 
	//the number of digits in the smaller input number. 

	//Space Complexity: O(1)
