// Radix sort is quite similar to sorting strings lexicographically. Out of any two string, one having larger
// character at the first point of difference would be lexicographically greater.
// We can extend this to integers if we pad up all integers with 0s to its left such that each has the same 
// number of digits.
// So what we do in radix sort is we start from the LSD and sort each number on the basis of the digit at current
// place using counting sort. We move from LSD to MSD and eventually the array is sorted.

// Time Complexity : O(nk) where k is the number of digits in the max_element

//                   of the loop countingSort function is called, whose complexity is O(n) as the loop inside countingSort 
//                   runs n times. So overall complexity of the algorithm is O(nk).
// Space Complexity : O(n) 
//                    10 vectors are created in each iteration which store a total of n elements. So total space
//                    required is O(n).

// The time complexity of counting sort is O(n+k) where k is the maximum element of the array. If k is significantly
// large then radixSort can be used instead of counting sort.
// When log(n) is significantly larger than k then radix sort can be used instead of nlog(n) sorting algoritms.
