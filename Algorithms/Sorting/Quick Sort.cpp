smaller arrays by dividing them across the pivot position and then again finding
pivot position in each of the sub-arrays and again partitioning each of them until

We can choose pivot as the median of array which can be found in linear time i.e, 
O(n) and then partition the array which will indeed chnage the worst case time complexity
from O(n^2) to O(n*log(n)). 
But, This median method is never used in practice because, the hidden constants in this approach are
higher than normal Quicksort's complexity.

/*
BEST CASE:
Best case will be when we will be having the partition always at middle of the array since it will
reduce the number of times we will have to make comparisons and we will be making comparisons 
n times. Each time the array will be divided by 2 untill we get a single element.
so, (n/2/2/2/2/2/.... so on) = 1.
so, (n/ (2^k) ) = 1.
so, n = 2^k.
so, k = log(n)

Thus the total time complexity in best case will be O(n log(n)).
*/

/*
WORST CASE:
Worst case will be when the partition will happen always at the end/start.
because in this case we will have to make maximum comparisons.
At the first turn we will make "n" comparisons.
At the second turn we will make "n-1" comparisons.
At the third turn we will make "n-2" comparisons.
...  so on

At the nth turn we will make 1 comparison.

So Total will be addition of these i.e, (n)(n-1)/2;
Thus the Order of time complexity will be (n^2)!
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
*/

/*
AVERAGE CASE:
Quick-Sort takes O(nlog(n)) time in expectation.
This is found after considering all the n! permutations of all the n elements in the array.
