// The idea behind the KMP algorithm is recovering from mismatches by using partial match information to skip
// over position where pattern can't be found and avoiding comparisons where we know that a prefix of the pattern
// already exists.
// Suppose the pattern is ACBAE and the text is like ACBAC.... . Now if we start moving from the 1st index of the 
// text there would be a mismatch when we reach 'C' . If we used the naive algorithm then we had to go back to the 
// 2nd index of the text and start comparisons from the beginning. This is avoided by the KMP algorithm.

// The pattern would not be found at the 2nd index as it doesn't start with 'C'.Same is true for the third index.
// But the pattern can be found starting at the 4th index as it starts with 'AC' .So we must start comparing
// the 3rd index of pattern with the next index of the text.
// This is what the lps array stores.The position of the pattern which must be compared with the next index incase 
// of a mismatch at next index of pattern. This is equivalent to the length of the longest prefix which is equal 
// to a suffix in the current portion. This way if we have precomputed the lps array then the pattern can be found 
// in single traversal of the text.

// Considering n = text_length, m = pattern_length

// Time Complexity :
// Pre-processing - O(m)
//                  The outer for loop runs m times. In each iteration j can either increase by 1 or decrease. During
//                  decrement in the worst case it can become 0. Also j can never exceed i.So j can decrease at most 
//                  as often it has been incresed by j++ which happens at most m times. So overall complexity becomes 
//                  O(2m) which is O(m).
// Searching - O(n)
//             The same logic as Pre-processing can be applied here. i either increases or decreases by 1. i decreases
//             only when cur != 0 and there's a mismatch. So it can decrease as much as cur increases which increases 
//             at most by 1 in 1 iteration. cur can increase at most by n so i can decrease at most by n.So overall
//             complexity becomes O(n).

// Space Complexity : O(m)
//                    The space required by the lps array is O(m).
