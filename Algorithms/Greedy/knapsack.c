SOME EXPLANATION ABOUT PROBLEM AND GREEDY APPROACH:
Greedy approach gives a solution for optimization Problem and always makes a choice which seems best at that moment and adds it to current subsolution . Final Output is optimal having maximum profit .
Greedy algorithm don't always yield optimal solution but,
when they do,they are usually the simplest and most efficient algorithms available.

the problems in fractional knapsack is to

--n items
--fraction of item i is taken to maximize profit unless the bag is full. Globally optimal choice is to take item with largest profit as p_i*(weight of object/weight remaining) and Greedy choice property for maximizing profit holds.
Dynamic Programming can solve Subproblems as well as overlapping Subproblems and finds a best solution by solving subproblems.

Fractional Knapsack can be solved using both Greedy algorithm and Dynamic Programming but 0-1 Knapsack can not be solved using greedy Algorithm because of following two key ingredient leading to DP solution,

0-1 Knapsack contains Optimal Substructure, an optimal solution to the problem contains within optimal solution of Subproblems.
Overlapping subproblems as same subproblem will be visited again and again (subproblem share sub-subproblem)
