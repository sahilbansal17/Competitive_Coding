//2.Check whether the set of vertices forms a circle or not if no

//Algorithm
//3.Repeat step 2 till edges<vertices-1,this is because a tress has
//edges=vertices-1
//Sorting of edges takes O(ELounion-find algorithm. The find and union
//operations can take atmost O(LogV) time. So overall complexity is
//O(ELogE + ELogV) time.
//The value of E can be atmost O(V2), so O(LogV) are O(LogE) same.
//Therefore, overall time complexity is O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)
