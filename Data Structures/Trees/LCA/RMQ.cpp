// Euler tour is the path along the tree that begins at the root and ends at the root, traversing 
// each edge exactly twice â€” once to enter the subtree at the other endpoint and once to leave it. 
// Whenever we reach a node, it is pushed into the baseArray. 
// If the path traced by the euler tour is carefully observed then we'll see that it stores the path
// between any two nodes of the tree and the LCA of the two nodes is the node with the minimum depth
// in the path.
// Consider this tree ->               1
// 		     		   / 	   \
// 			    	  2	    3
// 			       /    \
// 			      4	     5
// 		baseArray : 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1
// If we pick any two nodes of the tree we'll find a path between the nodes in the baseArray.
// eg - 5 and 3 : 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3

// Now using this observation we can find the LCA easily. Perform an euler tour and build the baseArray 
// and also assign the depth of each node wrt the root. Now for finding the LCA simply query for the minimum 
// depth between the first occurrence(Any occurrence would give the correct answer) of the nodes in the baseArray.
// This type of query can be easily answered using the segment tree.

// Time Complexity:
// Preprocessing -> 
// Euler Tour : DFS is done for creating the baseArray and assigning the depth to each node.
// 		Complexity of DFS = O(V+E)
// 		For a tree having n nodes E = n-1
// 		So complexity of this step = O(n)
// Building the segment tree : Each time a node is visited during the euler tour it is pushed into the baseArray.
// 		Corresponding to each edge of the tree 2 nodes are pushed into the baseArray as each edge is 
// 		traversed 2 times, once while going into the subtree and once while coming out and durign each
// 		traversal one node is pushed into the baseArray.The root is pushed into the baseArray at the start
// 		of the tour. So the total size of baseArray = 2*(n-1) + 1 = 2n-1
// 		We know for O(n) nodes the complexity of building a segment tree is O(n).
// 		Complexity of this step = O(n)
// Query -> Each query is simply range minimum query in the segment tree of size O(n).So time complexity per query
// 	    is O(log n).

// Space Complexity : O(n) space is required for segment tree as well as the input tree.
// 		      So overall space complexity is O(n).

// Comparison with other methods of finding LCA :
// 1) Naive approach :
//  	No Preprocessing required
//  	Query - O(n) as the tree needs to be traversed
// 	Space Complexity - O(n)

// 2) Sparse matrix DP approach :
// 	Preprocessing - O(nlogn)
// 			The 2-D DP array stores the 2^i th parent of each node.Now the value of i in 
// 			the worst case can be logN.So maximum number of ancestors stored for any node 
// 			can be logN.Filling up the DP array requires one DFS for assigning immediate parent 
// 			followed by filling up of DP array of size NlogN. 
// 	Query -	O(logn)
// 		The distance between node and LCA can be maximum 'n'.As the 2^i th parent is already computed
// 		reaching the LCA would require at most logn jumps.
// 	Space Complexity - O(nlogn)
// 			   2D DP array is of size nlogn as any node can have maximum logn parents.

// Now if we compare the RMQ approach with these 2 approaches, we see that the naive approach and RMQ approach
// have the same space complexity which is less than Sparse DP approach.

// If there is a single query naive approach can be used as it requires no preprocessing and answers query in 
// O(n), contrary to other approaches which require O(nlogn) time for preprocessing and O(logn) for query.

// If there are multiple queries then sparse DP approach or RMQ must be used as they require O(logn) time answering 
// per query. The time and space complexity of sparse DP approach is greater than the RMQ approach. So RMQ can be
// preffered.
