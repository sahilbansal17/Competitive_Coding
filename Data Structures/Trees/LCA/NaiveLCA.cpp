// In this algorithm we start dfs from the root and find the lowest node which has both the nodes v1 and v2
// in its subtree. In the dfs tree the first node i.e. the node at lowest depth which has both the nodes v1 and v2 
// in its subtree would be the LCA.

// Time complexity : Per query -> O(n)
// 		     Each query requires a dfs traversal. The completexity of dfs is O(V+E). For a tree E = n-1.
// 		     So complexity of dfs is O(n).
// Space Complexity : O(n)
// 		      Required for storing the input
