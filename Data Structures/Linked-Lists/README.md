[Forward List](forwardlist_using_stl.cpp)

- This Program is for making a linked List using #include<forward_list>.
- std::forward_list is a container that supports fast insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. 
- It is implemented as a singly-linked list and essentially does not have any overhead compared to its implementation in C.
- Compared to std::list this container provides more space efficient storage when bidirectional iteration is not needed.
   
   
[List implementations](list-implementation.cpp)

- This program is for implementing linkedList.
- It consists of insertion, deletion, traversal, search, reverse and splice operations.
  
[List using STL](list_using_stl.cpp)

- This is the implementaion of linkedlist using standard template library.

[Merge Sort](merge_sort.cpp)

- This Program demostrates the mergeSort Algorithm in linkedlist.
- In addition to this, midpoint of linkedlist and merging 2 sorted LL are also demonstrated.
    

[Reversing Linked List](reverse_linked_list.cpp)

- This program describes the 4 ways of revesing the linkedList, reversing of linkedList is a very important part in many algorithms.
- 3 recursive methods and 1 iterative method is provided.
