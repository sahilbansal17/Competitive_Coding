forwardlist_using_stl.cpp

    This Program is for making a linked List using #include<forward_list> this std::forward_list is a container that supports fast 
    insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. 
    It is implemented as a singly-linked list and essentially does not have any overhead compared to its implementation in C. 
    Compared to std::list this container provides more space efficient storage when bidirectional iteration is not needed.
   
   
list-implementation.cpp

    This program is for implementing linkedList .IT CONSISTS OF INSERTION, DELETION, TRAVERSAL, SEARCH, REVERSE, SPLICE.
    This is the simple implementation of linkedlist program.
  
  
list_using_stl.cpp

    This is the implementaion of linkedlist using standard template library.Using inbuild functions etc in STL.
    

merge_sort.cpp

    This Program demostrate the mergeSort Algorithm in linkedlist
    In addition to this midpoint of linkedlist and merging 2 sorted LL are also demonstrated.
    

reverse_linked_list.cpp

    This program describes the 4 ways of revesing the linkedList,reversing of linkedList is a very important part in amany algorithms
    3 are the recursive ways and 1 is iterative way.
